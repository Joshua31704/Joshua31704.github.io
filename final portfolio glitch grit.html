      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        Ah, the Glitch and Grit assignment. This is probably the most complex assignment I have done which has
      tested my skills. Not only I had to apply the prior learned skills from all the other assignments listed from
      above, I had to create a website from scratch.</p>
       <p style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        The Glitch and Grit assignment required me to make a three page 
         HTML website composed of low-res, compressed, or distorted images. 
         It's a website, so there's no imagery to show other than the links below... (I could obviously show the
      images from the website but I'd rather you actually visit it)</p>
      <p style="color: #af110a; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        <u>I DO RECOMMEND STARTING WITH "Intro" LINK, BUT DO WHAT YOU WANT! </u></p>
       <p style="color: #af110a; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        <u>also.. you will have to use your browser to return to this page.. soz..</u></p>
      <nav>
    <ul style="font-family: serif">
      <li><a href="glitch_grit_project/intro.html">Intro</a></li>
      <li><a href="glitch_grit_project/texture.html">Texture</a></li>
      <li><a href="glitch_grit_project/echo.html">Echo</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
      <h2 style="text-align: center; color: darkgoldenrod;font-family: serif">Technical Notes</h2>
      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        Phcode.io <u>(this website is also made from it!)</u> was used to make the site. Adobe Photoshop was used to
        create the imagery in "Intro" and "Texture". Images obtained from Google.</p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center; color: darkgoldenrod;font-family: serif">Process Documentation</h2>
      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
         By far the most complex work I've had to do. However, for my own sanity, I sought to have fun with it.
      Of course, I placed my own hobby of menswear into it and I took a light-hearted approach and made silly
      imagery with accomodating commentary. I created a rather.. whimsical.. image for the first page and made
      an easygoing GIF of a tailor doing work. Final page had more serious, grounded examples of what I actually
      liked in menswear.</p>
       <h2 style="text-align: center; color: darkgoldenrod;font-family: serif">Reflection</h2>
        <p style="color: darkgoldenrod; font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
          This project was seriously accomplishing to do. Never would have thought that I'd actually make a website,
      even if it's the product of an amateur. I've been on the internet from such a young age but lacked any desire
      to do this, but it was certainly rewarding. I've said this many times already, but it was really fun. Making
      the website wasn't even that hard either. Of course, there is a lot more complex code but there's no need
      for me to get into that as I'm not necessarily planning on being a serious coder. In any case, I think it's a
      rather useful skill to have: knowing how to make a site. The world has gone so digital nowadays so having that
      ability is something I don't mind having under my belt.</p>
