      <h2 style="text-align: center;color: darkgoldenrod;font-family: serif">About Myself</h2>
      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">As of the creation of this page, 
        I am currently a student in the art department at UWF. 
        Prior to that, I was in legal studies but found that I hardly enjoyed it  but appreciated the fantasy lifestyle
      often promoted in media. In particular, the suiting. Clothing has always been something integral to me prior to
      me chasing a law degree but I had never taken it seriously as a career choice until recently. 
        I was convinced by one of the art instructors during my art appreciation class last year to join the 
        department as it was clear I had a dormant passion to chase that dream, even if it wasn't clear. Since then,
      I have dabbled here and there with many of the art classes assigned 
        to me but have had a significant passion with tailoring;
      taking classes considered "outside" the art department such as 
        costume construction/design in the theatre department and even
      going as far as to arrange a directed independent study to learning men's tailoring.</p>
      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">As aforementioned, 
        I have dabbled with many of the art forms presented 
        to me in my classes due to the nature of degrees in general. Obviously, digital studio is one of those classes.
      Admittedly I thought it would stick to relatively "simple" subjects, such making artwork on Adobe. 
        I was already familiar with Paint.NET so I wasn't too concerned. 
        Working on our assignments that mainly dealt with photoshop was 
        generally easeful for me as I used to make Youtube thumbnails back in middle school. 
        Of course, I still learned how to use tools I had no experience with. 
        The biggest one probably being the frame animation tool.
        However, the moment coding was brought up,
      I was a little worried that the class was going to be complex. I had dabbled in computer-ish stuff before. 
        However, the knowledge had pretty much disappeared in my mind due to uninterest.</p>
      <p style="color: darkgoldenrod;font-size: x-large;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        To my suprise however, it wasn't really bad at all. What I thought was intimidating wasn't really hard at all.
      To me, you just have to follow rules and guidelines embedded in code and the experience would be smooth. I assume
      that my prior law school mindset had made me see it that way. Anyhow, it was really cool and shocking to see myself
      make a webpage as I had always thought they were incredibly technically difficult things to do. 
        That is to say, the complex sites are almost certainly hard in any case... This site isn't like that.
      Neither are my projects. They are just simple, fun exercies to express my hobby.</p>
      <p style="color: #af110a;font-size: medium;font-family: serif;text-align: center">
        <u>You'll notice that there are 5 projects at the top of the page. There was.. more... 
          I didn't get around to doing them unfortunately. I sure you'll still enjoy the work I DID complete though!</u></p>
